## Hi there! I'm Clébio Oliveira Júnior

<h3><i>Physics Teacher and Data Scientist</i></h3>

I'm physics a teacher and a data scientist who loves open source programs and tools. I have master's degree in natural science period during which I developed my research using Python for data analysis and data processing. 

Since then, I have studied python, data science, classic machine learning algorithms and neural networks. Therefore, I have made data science projects focused in business solutions with machine learning models.

I have already developed solutions for important problems such as algorithms able to detect fraud in transactions, classify early cases of cardiovascular diseases, identify customers in churn and prioritize customers for cross-selling.

The details of each solution are described in the data science project section.

## Data Science Projects

- ### [Health Insurance Cross Sell](https://github.com/juniorcl/health-insurance-cross-sell)

    To help the sales team, this data science project was created to sort a list to improve the cross-selling. The model was able to organize that almost all interested customers (98.31% +/- 0.16%) stay on up to 50% of the list, saving half of the expenses incurred for calls. So, if each call costs R\$ 15.00 in 20,000.00 there is an expense of R\$ 300,000.00. Using the model it is possible to spend only R$ 150,000.00.

- ### [Transaction Fraud Detection](https://github.com/juniorcl/transaction-fraud-detection)

    Financial transactions fraud is one of the biggest problems faced by financial institutions. Thus, this project uses data science and machine learning to detect and avoid fraudulent transactions. The model got a precision of 96.3% +/- 0.7% and a recall of 76.3% +/- 3.5%. The profit expected by the company is R$ 57,251,574.44.

- ### [Churn Prediction](https://github.com/juniorcl/churn-prediction)

    When a client churns, it represents a problem, which results in money loss for the company. In this project, I created a solution using data to predict such behavior and avoid it. The machine learning model was able to detect 76.5% of the client which could churn, by using unseen data as example. It represents a recovery of R$ 2,878,197.97 for the company.

- ### [Cardiovascular Disease Prediction](https://github.com/juniorcl/cardiovascular-disease-prediction)

    Cardio Catch Disease is a company specialized in detecting heart diseases in early stages. For every 5% above 50% of prediction accuracy, there is an increase of 50% on the value charged per client. So, in this data science project, I created a model with a recognition rate of 71.8% +/- 0.5% and the estimated profit generated by using this model may be about R$ 11,285,500.00.

- ### [Rossman Store Sales](https://github.com/juniorcl/rossman-store-sales)

    To ideate a new strategy of investments in for each sale store may be difficult. Therefore, to help the stack holders to make decisions about individual investments for each and every store in the chain, this data science project created a machine learning model able to predict the sales up to six weeks in advance. Hence, enabling them to calculate the profit per store and the amount of money available to invest.
